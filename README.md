# Pytorch fundamentals

Set of simple Pytorch scritps for better understanding pytorch fundamentals: tensors, loss functins, modules.

Some of examples are taken from https://pytorch.org/tutorials/ 


## Examples

* [autograd.py](autograd.py) - simple example showing how autograd mechanism works
* [cuda_device_info.py](cuda_device_info.py) - how to check if cuda is available
* [tensors.py](tensors.py)- how to create tensor
* [shapes.py](shapes.py) - how to check tensor shape and reshapes to another dimension using 'view' function
* [loss_functions.py]() - how differnet loss function works (L1, mse, crossentrophy etc)
* [dorpout.py]() - how to apply dropout and why it scale output
* [nn_blocks.py](nn_blocks.py) - building blocks 
* [lstm_input.py](lstm_input.py)- how to prepare input for lstm, how to read output from lstm layer

* [loss_functions.py](loss_functions.py)- how loss functions work and how theri output look like

* [loss_functions_combined.py](loss_functions_combined.py)- how to combine valued from more then one loss function, 

* [softmax_accuracy.py](softmax_accuracy.py)- how compute softmax for multilabel multivalue output and how to compute accuracy based on softmax output
